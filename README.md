Innoloft Assignment
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
- git clone <repo>
- yarn install
- yarn dev
```
To change the configuration create a .env.local file and set the APP_ID

App is build using next.js because instead of focusing on what I need to build an app, I was able to focus on what I need to build.
